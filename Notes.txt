Threads
- Run within the same process
- Share memory and variables
- Context switching is cheaper compared to switching processes
- Threads die when the parent process dies
- CRuby (MRI) has a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) so only one thread is using the core at a time, and cannot span multiple cores
  - In most cases that's not a problem: http://yehudakatz.com/2010/08/14/threads-in-ruby-enough-already
- JRuby uses o/s level threads, can span multiple cores
- Show thread sample, run with ruby and jruby, watch cpu
- Show log file downloader.
